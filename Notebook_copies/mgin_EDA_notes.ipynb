Aspects we'll want to explore about the data will include checks for missing data points and consideration remedies for missing fields as well as cross-correlation of variables with missing data.\n",

    "We'll also want to investigate the number categories distribution for the categorical data.  This will be particularly useful in helping to determine if we need to do additional feature engineering and can affect our strategy for predicting labels.\n",
